# Who Funds RVM?

Initially the vast majority of RVM development, including speaking about it at events,
has happened on Wayne and Michal own personal time and budget.

With time Engineyard started supporting project by employing Michal in years 2013-2014.

After that a [fundraiser was started to support full time development of RVM 2.0](https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/489-rvm-2-0).

There is a [list of awesome people](/credits/donations/) who have donated to the project in early stages.
