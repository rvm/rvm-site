%p
  Please note that the first thing you should do is check the 
  %em rvm notes
  for your operating system, as this covers most common items.
  To do this, run:
  
= sh_cmd "rvm notes"

%p
  Along the same lines, you should only need to install curl and git
  to install rvm itself - then, you'll need the tools specific to your
  OS to build actual rubies.
