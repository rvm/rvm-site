%h2 Debugging RVM

%p
  The easiest way to get help with rvm is to join the #rvm channel
  on freenode - You can use a
  %a{:href => "http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rvm"} web based client
  if you don't have one installed. If you're unable to chat in the channel,
  make sure you
  %a{:href => "http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-User-Name-on-Freenode"} register your nick first

%p
  If you encounter an issue with rvm, you can make it greatly easier
  for use by following the steps below. Namely, each will help provide
  insight into what is going wrong.

%h3 Tracking Down Bugs

%p
  If you do encounter a bug, the first (and most important) information we need
  is related to how rvm is loaded. You should first ensure that rvm is loaded as a function.
  You can do this by running:

= sh_cmd "type rvm | head -n1"

%p
  Which should output "rvm is a function". If it shows anything else, rvm isn't
  being loaded correctly. For information on why this occurs and how to solve it,
  please see
  %a{:href => "/rvm/install/"} the bottom of the installation instructions.

%p
  Next, when telling us the problem, we need two sets of information. Namely, the output
  of running 'rvm debug', like so:

= sh_cmd "rvm debug"

%p
  And the output of running the broken command with the trace option, e.g.:

= sh_cmd "rvm use ree"

%p
  Would need to be run as:

= sh_cmd "rvm --trace use ree"

%p
  When sharing this information with us in IRC, you need to use a site like
  %a{:href => "http://gist.github.com/"} gist
  or
  %a{:href => "http://pastie.org/"} pastie.
  We prefer to use gist as it lets us easily fork
  your results and provide edited output but either will suffice.

%p
  Lastly, please ensure you've read
  %a{:href => "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html"} "How to Report Bugs Effectively"
  in order to speed up the whole process.
