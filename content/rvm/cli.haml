  RVM CLI Usage
%p
  RVM comes with many options, however it has lots of defaults that are intended to make the command line API much more 'natural'.

  :preserve
    rvm help

%h3
  RVM general usage API
%pre.code
  :preserve
    rvm [action] [interpreter] [options]
%a{ :name => "cli-actions" }
%h3
  Where "action" is one of
%pre.code
  :preserve
    use       - setup current shell to use a specific ruby version
    [interpreter]
              - when used as an action it is a silent 'use'
    system
    reset     - remove default and current settings, exit the shell.
    info      - show information for current ruby
    list      - show currently installed versions
    reload    - reload RVM source itself (useful after changing RVM source)
    implode   - removes all ruby installations it manages, everything in ~/.rvm
    get       - {stable,head} upgrades RVM to the stale or git head branches.
    do        - runs a named ruby file against specified and/or all rubies

    install   - install one or many ruby versions
    upgrade   - install new ruby, copy gemsets, make gems pristine, remove old ruby
    reinstall - remove ruby, install it, make gems pristine
    uninstall - uninstall one or many ruby versions, leaves their sources
    remove    - uninstall one or many ruby versions and remove their sources
