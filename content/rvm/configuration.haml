%h1
  RVM Configuration
%p
  RVM has a configuration directory located in $rvm_config_path which for a typical installation as user to their
  $HOME directory will be located in ~/.rvm/config/
%h2
  Defaults
%p
  RVM has a set of defaults recorded in the file
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $rvm_config_path/db
%p
  This file is replaced each time you upgrade RVM so do not edit it.

%h2
  Overriding Default Settings
%p
  In order to override RVM's default settings, simply place the appropriate key=value entry into the file
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $rvm_config_path/user
%p
  RVM will then use these settings instead of RVM's defaults.
%h3 Example
%p
  From the troubleshooting page we saw that ruby 1.8.7-p249 had a segfaulting bug on some systems, the fix was to downgrade 1.8.7 to p174 until this was fixed in a future release.
  In order to override the default patchlevel of 1.8.7 to 174, we place the following string into $rvm_config_path/user:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ruby_1.8.7_patch_level=174
%p
  Then 'rvm use 1.8.7' will use 'ruby-1.8.7-p174' instead of the default recorded in $rvm_config_path/db
