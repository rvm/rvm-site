%h1 Installing RVM

%p There are two fundamentally different ways to install and configure RVM. 

%ul
  %li Single-User Installation as a standard user
  %li Multi-User installation as root

%p <strong>For most purposes, the recommended installation method is Single-User</strong>, which is a self-contained rvm installation in a user's home directory. 


%p <strong>All multi-user instructions must be run as root.</strong> The installation process is similar for both installation methods; any differences will be noted in the instructions below. 

%h4 To update an existing RVM installation

%p 
  It is safe to run the installation script again, or follow the
  %a{:href => "/rvm/upgrading/"}
    upgrading docs.    
         
%h2 Installation 

%p I recommend you <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm">read the installation script yourself</a>; you will understand what it is doing and feel more comfortable running it. 
    
%h3 1. Download and run the RVM installation script
%h4 Installing the latest release version in git:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
 
%h4 Installing a specific version:

%pre.code
  :preserve 
    curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm -o rvm-installer ; chmod +x rvm-installer ; ./rvm-installer 1.5.3
       
%h4 Single-User Install Location: ~/.rvm/
%p
  If the install script is run as standard, non-root user, rvm will install into the current users's home directory. 
    
%h4 Multi-User Install Location: /usr/local/rvm
%p
  If the install script is run as root, rvm will automatically install into /usr/local/rvm 
    
%p
  <strong>If the rvm install script does nothing or complains about certificates</strong>  
  you can bypass this by adding a '-k' switch to the curl command: 

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ bash < <(curl -sk https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
     
%h3 2. Load RVM into your shell sessions as a function
%em 
  Throughout these instructions, you may replace .bash_profile with the appropriate startup script for your bash-compatible shell. For other shells you may need to modify these commands.  
%p
  Append RVM function setup to your .bash_profile:
  
%h4 Single-User:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ echo '[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function >> ~/.bash_profile

%h4 Multi-User:
 
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ echo '[[ -s "/usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "/usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM function >> ~/.bash_profile

%p 
  %em Multi-User Install Note: The rvm function must be configured for every user you wish to use rvm.
 
      
%h4 3. Reload shell configuration & test

%p Open a new shell or reload your .bash_profile with the following command:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ source .bash_profile
    
%p If configuration and installation was performed correctly, this command should output 'rvm is a function':

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ type rvm | head -1
    
%p See if there are any dependencies for your operating system by running:  
  
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm notes    
    
%h4 Congratulations! You have successfully installed RVM.

%p
  <strong>Multi-User Install Note:</strong> After installation, where you would normally use 'sudo', non-root users will need to use 'rvmsudo' (e.g. <code>rvmsudo gem install xxxx</code>). This may affect or break some deployment scripts.
  E.G:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    # Wrong, will fail
    $ sudo gem install xxxx 
    # Right
    $ rvmsudo gem install xxxx 

    
%h3 3. Let's try out your new RVM installation:

%em I've included the (truncated) output of each command on my system as an example.

%p Display list of all "known" rubies (RVM can install many more rubies not listed):
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm list known

%p Install a version of ruby (eg 1.9.2):

%p Check this worked correctly:  
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ ruby -v 
    ruby 1.9.2p180 (2011-02-18 revision 30909) [i386-darwin9.8.0]
    $ which ruby
    Using /Users/user/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180
        
%p Optionally, set a version of ruby to use as the default for new shells (overrides the 'system' ruby):

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm use 1.9.2 --default

%h2 Enjoy using RVM!
