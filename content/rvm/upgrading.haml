  Upgrading RVM
%p
  RVM supports few ways of upgrading itself.
%p
  Every month or two a
  %b stable
  release of RVM is created, it includes minor version increase.
  Between releases only bugfixes and ruby version updates are added
  to it with teeny version update. Normal development and major changes
  continue on master branch to install it use
  %b head
  version. It's important to use head version before reporting errors as
  those could be already fixed.

%h3
  To upgrade to the most stable version
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm get stable
%p
  installs the stable version.

%h3
  Upgrading to the latest repository source version (the most bugfixes)
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm get head
%p
  obtains the latest RVM repository version.

%h3
  Installer also will update RVM:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable # update to stable
    $ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s head   # update to head
    $ rvm reload
%p
  Yes, there's a backslash before the <b>curl</b>. It is important to reload after using installer for update.

%h3
  Auto update sourcing line
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm get stable --auto
%p
  by using the auto flag RVM will know to update the user configuration
  files to the best known way of sourcing RVM.

%h3
  Latest
%p
  In early days RVM was developed only on master branch, versions were
  released to RVM server and when version was bug free the
  %b latest
  file was updated to point to it. This has changed, as mentioned above
  RVM stable is released and only bugfixes / ruby version updates are
  applied to it. The current equivalent of
  %b latest
  is
  %b stable
  and should be used
  %b instead.
  When updating very old versions
  %b head
  should be used and can be followed by
  %b stable.

%h3
  Upgrading to someones else forked branch
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm get branch [owner/][branch]
%p
  obtains the given branch possibly from the given owner, examples:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm get branch shoes        # shoes  branch from wayneeseguin rvm repository
    $ rvm get branch mpapis/      # master branch from mpapis rvm repository
    $ rvm get branch mpapis/shoes # shoes  branch from mpapis rvm repository
