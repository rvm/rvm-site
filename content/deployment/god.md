Using RVM with God
==================
  
To use god (or any other application that needs to be started with init.d) with RVM, you need to generate a wrapper script. Namely, you need to set it up so that there is an alternative executable that loads the correct gemset.

As an example, if you'd installed god under Ruby Enterprise Edition in the management gemset (aka. "ree@management"), you would do the following:
    
    rvm wrapper ree@management bootup god

Running this command will generate the executable bootup_god in `~/.rvm/bin` or, if you have installed RVM system wide, in /usr/local/rvm/bin.

Thus, when setting up your init files, instead of using the direct path to god, you would instead use the path to bootup_god. As an example, you could add the following to /etc/rc.local (although we suggest using the init.d system of choice for your operating system):

    /home/your-long/.rvm/bin/bootup_god -c /path/to/config.god --log /var/log/god.log --no-syslog --log-level warn

Also, please note that any gems you reference in your god configurations that are under other gemsets or rubies (such as thin or thor), you will need to also generate wrapper scripts (and hence, use the path for them) via:

    rvm wrapper ruby@gemset [scope] [binary-name]

Where `[scope]` is the prefix for the executable (e.g. god before and binary-name is the binary to generate a wrapper for. Hence, creating 
`$rvm_bin_path/[scope]_[binary-name]`, 
e.g. `~/.rvm/bin/myapp_thin`.

Lastly, you would replace all calls to 'thin' or the path to 'thin' in your god configs with the path to the wrapper instead.
