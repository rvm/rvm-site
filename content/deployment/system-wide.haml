%h1 Installing RVM System Wide

%p
  For your convenience, we provide a script you can run on most linux systems (tested on Ubuntu 10.04)
  that you can by performing:

= sh_cmd "bash < <( curl -L http://bit.ly/rvm-install-system-wide )"

%p
  Once that is run, you need to remember a few rules whenever giving someone access to the system wide
  ruby install. Namely:

%ul
  %li
    You still need to edit the profile files like in a
    %a{:href => "/rvm/install/"} normal installation
    but instead of pointing to $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm you instead point it towards /usr/local/lib/rvm
  %li
    You need to add the user to the rvm group before doing anything.
    Otherwise, there will be permission errors.

%p
  Like wise, if you intend to have a user specific install, even if the user isn't in the rvm group,
  you need to edit ~/.rvmrc to manually override the path values set in /etc/rvmrc


%h3 Explanation

%p
  System Wide installs differ from typical rvm installs since they are not constraint to
  a single user - primarily, system wide installs are designed for the express purpose of
  one install with multiple users.

%p
  The process to install system wide currently requires you start from git and roughly involves:

%ul
  %li Ensuring the user is root.
  %li Loading existing configs.
  %li Setting rvm to install into /usr/local/rvm
  %li Cloning and installing RVM
  %li Creating a group for RVM and adding root as a member.
  %li Changing /usr/local/rvm, /usr/local/bin, /etc/rvmrc and associated files to be owned by the previously created group.
  %li Making sure the aforementioned files and directories are group writeable.
  %li Setting rvm_path, rvm_prefix, rvm_bin_path and rvm_man_path in /etc/rvmrc.

%p
  By taking advantage of group file / directory permissions and /etc/rvmrc, we make it possible for multiple
  users to use the same gemsets and rubies.

%p
  Please note than in the current incarnation, setting a default / creating aliases and the like are
  shared between all users.
