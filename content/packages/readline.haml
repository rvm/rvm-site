  Quick fix
%p
  Update RVM:
  = sh_cmd "rvm get head"
  Remove all the manually installed packages:
  = sh_cmd "rvm pkg remove"
  Install the required libraries:
  = sh_cmd "rvm requirements run"
  Reinstall ruby:
  = sh_cmd "rvm reinstall 1.9.3"

%h2
  Readline
%p
  If you have an error when compiling pertaining to readline, you may need to attempt installing with the procedure defined below.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm pkg install readline
    $ rvm reinstall 1.9.2 --with-readline-dir=$rvm_path/usr
%p
  Note that this error occurs most often when having a MacPorts, Fink, or Homebrew installed readline on your system.
  The next most often is when the readline development headers are not available at all. The above
  commands solve this by having RVM compile a local version inside ~/.rvm/usr and then telling the ruby
  install to use it. If you have readline already installed using one of the above-mentioned package managers,
  you can use that readline by exchanging the location such as the following:
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm reinstall 1.9.2 --with-readline-dir=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/x.x.x

  %strong Note:
  In the above case, we are compiling using the Homebrew readline installation.
  In the example, as well, you would need to replace 'x.x.x' with the correct version string.
  <br /><br />

  If you have already installed your Ruby then you can manually recompile readline
  as follows. Be sure to first install the readline development headers and/or
  package as above. For example with 1.9.2-p0 and system readline development
  headers installed do the following.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ cd $rvm_path/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0/ext/readline
    $ ruby extconf.rb
    $ make install

%p
  If you used 'rvm pkg install readline' then alter the above to:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ cd $rvm_path/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0/ext/readline
    $ ruby extconf.rb -- --with-readline-dir="$rvm_path/usr"
    $ make install
%p
  If you would like to automatically use the RVM default you can override config/db
  ruby configure setting in user/db like this:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    # ~/.rvm/user/db or /usr/local/rvm/user/db
    ruby_configure_flags=--enable-shared --disable-install-doc --with-readline-dir="$rvm_path/usr"

%p
  In case of compilation problems try:
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm --skip-autoreconf pkg install readline
