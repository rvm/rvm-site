  Quick fix
%p
  Remove all the manually installed packages:
  = sh_cmd "rm -rf $rvm_path/usr"
  Find the requirements (follow the instructions):
  = sh_cmd "rvm requirements"
  Reinstall ruby:
  = sh_cmd "rvm reinstall 1.9.3"

%h2
  OpenSSL

%p
  Common issues that point to an issue with an MRI Ruby compiling openssl are:

%ul
  %li
    require "openssl" # !> LoadError: cannot load such file -- openssl
  %li
    Error compiling openssl due to openssl version 1.0.0* installed on the system.

%p
  If you have issues with openssl not being available in ruby / irb please try the following configure option you may follow the procedure below.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm reinstall 1.9.2 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local

%p
  Where you replace '/usr/local' with the prefix where your openssl packages are.

%p
  If you can not get this to work you can have RVM install a copy of openssl
  into ~/.rvm/usr like so:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm pkg install openssl
      $ rvm reinstall 1.9.2 --with-openssl-dir=$rvm_path/usr

%p
  Adjust the location if you have a root install to '/usr/local/rvm/usr'
%p
  If you see readline errors in the make.error.log
  %a{ :href => "/packages/readline/" }
    visit the readline page
  also.

%p
  In case of compilation problems try:
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm --skip-autoreconf pkg install openssl
