  OpenSSL

%p
  Common issues that point to an issue with an MRI Ruby compiling openssl are:

%ul
  %li
    require "openssl" # => false ?!
  %li
    Error compiling openssl due to openssl version 1.0.0* installed on the system.

%p
  If you have issues with openssl not being available in ruby / irb please try the following configure option you may follow the procedure below.
%p
  NOTE: Before you follow the procedure below please be sure to verify that you
  have installed any dependencies for the ruby you are installing listed by the
  'rvm notes' command. If you have not yet done that do so then run
  'rvm remove X ; rvm install X' where X is the ruby that you are concerned with.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm remove 1.9.2 # This ensures that you will not have any leftovers from the last run
    $ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local

%p
  Where you replace '/usr/local' with the prefix where your openssl packages are.

%p
  If you can not get this to work you can have RVM install a copy of openssl
  into ~/.rvm/usr like so:
  %br
  %pre.code
    :preserve
      $ rvm pkg install openssl
      $ rvm remove 1.9.2
      $ rvm install 1.9.2 --with-openssl-dir=$rvm_path/usr

%p
  Adjust the location if you have a root install to '/usr/local/rvm/usr'
%p
