  Autoconf

%p
  If your ruby (usually 1.9.2-head / trunk) fails to compile and the make error log shows
  that you do not have a current enough version of autoconf ::cough:: CentOS ::cough:: then
  you can install it into your RVM.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm package install autoconf

%p
  Note that autoconf will be installed to ~/.rvm/bin so be sure it is in your path.
%p
  If it is not in your path you can add it like this
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ export PATH=$rvm_path/bin:$PATH

%p
  Once autoconf has been installed, you can then (re) install your ruby
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ rvm install 1.9.2-head
