# Using MacPorts with RVM

RVM Uses MacPorts by default (if installed) read more about [autolibs](/rvm/autolibs).

For old instructions before autolibs visit [MacPorts before Autolibs](/integration/macports-before-autolibs)

In case of problems with MacPorts you can try Homebrew:

    rvm autolibs homebrew
