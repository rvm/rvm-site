%h2
  Fish Shell

%p
  Since RVM is a large collection of bash scripts and fish is not bash-compatible,
  users of fish need a wrapper around RVM to make it work properly with that shell.
  Since RVM just manipulates environment variables, we just need a way to preserve
  those changes.

%p
  Please note that better fish support (although not native) is expected in the future.

%h2 Install
%p
  Install RVM
  %a{:href => "/rvm/install/"} as you would for use with bash.
  When running the `rvm-install` command, feel free to ignore the advice under the
  "You must now finish the install manually" section.

%h2 Setup
%p
  Download the fish functions from GitHub, the first a utility function to capture the
changes to environment variables, the second a wrapper around RVM for fish.
%pre.code
  :preserve
     set -l GITHUB https://raw.github.com/lunks/fish-nuggets/master/functions
     \curl --create-dirs -o ~/.config/fish/functions/rvm.fish $GITHUB/rvm.fish
     \curl -o ~/.config/fish/functions/cd.fish $GITHUB/cd.fish
%p
  Note the backslash before <b>curl</b>.

%h2 Usage
%p
  Use RVM just as you would in bash or zsh as per the instructions on the website,
  converting any bashisms to fish as needed.
