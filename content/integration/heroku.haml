%h1 Using RVM with Heroku

%p
  %a{:href => "http://heroku.com/", :name => "Heroku"}
  is a deployment platform for running rails application on a scalable architecture.

%p
  Heroku provides a managed multi-tenant environment to run rails applications and does not provide a mechanism for running RVM directly since
  client apps do not have access to a configurable environment or command line. However RVM remains a useful tool for managing developments
  and making sure that development and test environments match the environment on Heroku's platform.

%p
  Check which version of the Heroku stack your app will be deployed on (
  %a{:href => "http://docs.heroku.com/stack"}
  or by running the Herou command line `heroku stack`) and setup your .rvmrc to use the same Ruby version as your stack.
