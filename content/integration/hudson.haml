%h1 Continious Integration with Hudson

%p
  Integrating rvm with
  %a{:href => "http://hudson-ci.org/"} hudson
  not only allows you to test multiple projects
  with different gemsets yet it also lets you test varying codebases against
  multiple rubies at the same time. The follow guide is aimed based primarily
  on a Ubuntu install but the instructions should be compatible with
  any platform. Please note these instructions were based off of Nick Quaranto's
  %a{:href => "http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/712609699/sailing-down-the-hudson-with-rvm"} excellent blog post
  on the thoughbot blog and adapted for more general purpose use.

%h2 General Overview

%p
  In general, you need to:

%ul
  %li Have hudson setup on a special user
  %li Setup rvm (optionally with rvm settings to automatically install rubies)
  %li Use rvmrc's where possible / bundle install in shell tasks with the -x passed to the shebang.
  %li Source rvm manually if it's not available.

%p
  For a more detailed guide, see below:

%h2 Step 1. Getting and Installing Hudson 

%p
  The first step is to install hudson on your system of choice. Currently,
  you have several ways of getting it:

%ol
  %li Installing via os-level packages (in our case, the debian package)
  %li Downloading and setting it up manually
  %li
    Using
    %a{:href => "http://github.com/cowboyd/hudson.rb"} hudson.rb
    (which bundles common plugins etc)

%p
  If you choose method two or three, you'll need to first create a new user
  for hudson (typically called 'hudson'). In our case, we'll use the first option
  by following
  %a{:href => "http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Installing+Hudson+on+Ubuntu"} the instructions
  on the official hudson website. This approach takes care of automatically setting
  up init.d for us and also automatically creates the hudson user.

%p
  If setting it up manually, I would suggest installing hudson via hudson.rb for
  the niceties it offers.

%h2 Step 2. Setting up RVM

%p
  The next step is arguably the most important - you need to actually setup rvm for the
  hudson user added in the last step. First things first, we need to install all the dependencies.
  In this case, we'll follow the
  %a{:href => '/os/ubuntu/'} ubuntu page
  and rvm notes by installing the items required to build each ruby.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    sudo apt-get install curl bison build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline5-dev libxml2-dev git-core

%p
  Note that if you wish to also run ci against jruby, you'll need to install more packages
  including the jdk - see the ubuntu page linked above for more information.

%p
  Next, you'll need to login as the ubuntu user, in this case - hudson.

%pre.code
  :preserve
    sudo -Hiu hudson

%p
  This should put you at a shall with bash loaded. So, now you can run the instructions
  on the
  %a{:href => "/rvm/install/"} rvm installation
  page - We strongly suggest using the rvm-install-head method
  setting it up only for the hudson user.

%p
  Next, we need to add rvm to our shell profile - in this case, we'll add the following
  to the end of our ~/.bashrc:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

%p
  Also, with ubuntu the default .bashrc has a line containing "&& return" - If the
  same is true for your system, please ensure your replace it with an if as instructed
  but the rvm install.

%p
  Lastly, if we exit and relogin as hudson, rvm should now be loaded. You
  can confirm this by typing:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    type rvm | head -n1

%p
  Which should result in 'rvm is a function'.

%p
  Lastly, we'll add the following lines to ~/.rvmrc as the hudson user
  to make the actual process easier in general:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    rvm_install_on_use_flag=1
    rvm_project_rvmrc=1
    rvm_gemset_create_on_use_flag=1

%p
  For an explanation of what each means, please see the
  %a{:href => "/workflow/rvmrc/"} rvmrc page
  which goes into detail about each one / the appropriate
  sections of this documentation - the general idea with this
  approach is when we first use a ruby / gemset, rvm will automatically
  install the ruby and create a gemset.

%h2 Step 3. Configuring Hudson / Adding projects

%p
  For the actual hard work, we'll simply be using the ability to run
  a shell script with hudson. 
%p
  Our suggested setup is to use scripts like follows with the hudson
  option to "Execute Shell Script":

%pre.code
  :preserve
    #!/bin/bash -x
    # Use the correct ruby
    rvm use "ruby@gemset"
    # Do any setup
    # e.g. possibly do 'rake db:migrate db:test:prepare' here
    bundle install
    # Finally, run your tests
    rake

%p
  The -x option causes bash to exit if any commands exit with
  an error. This is key to making the script work as expected.
  
%p
  Note that in some setups the environment may not be loaded correctly.
  In these situations, you should add the following below the shebang:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

%p
  If you wish to use matrix builds, this approach means you can simply define
  an environment variable e.g. build_ruby and set the matrix fields to be
  each ruby you wish to use, replacing the rvm use line with:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    rvm use "$build_ruby@gemset-to-use"

%p
  Lastly, if you wish to use rubies from an rvmrc automatically / handle
  setup that way, you may want to add:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    [[ -s ".rvmrc" ]] && source .rvmrc

%p
  In place of the rvm use command / associated setup.
