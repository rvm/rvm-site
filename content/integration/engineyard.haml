%h1 Using RVM with EngineYard AppCloud

%p
  %a{:href => "http://www.engineyard.com/", :name => "EngineYard"}
  %a{:href => "http://www.engineyard.com/products/appcloud", :name => "AppCloud"}
  is a deployment platform for running rails application on a scalable architecture.

%p
  EngineYard provides a managed environment of pre-configured instances setup to run rails applications and does not currently provide a mechanism for
  running RVM on those instances. However RVM remains a useful tool for managing development machines and making sure that development and test
  environments match the environment on AppCloud instances.

%p
  Check your AppCloud Environment's settings (on the AppCloud dashboard:
  %a{:href => "https://cloud.engineyard.com/dashboard"}
  or by referencing the supported stack:
  %a{:href => "http://www.engineyard.com/products/technology/stack"}
  ) and setup your .rvmrc to use the same Ruby version as your AppCloud deployment.

  You can follow changes to the AppCloud stack on Twitter:
