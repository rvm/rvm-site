%h1 Integrating RVM with gnome-terminal

%p
  If you are going to use RVM installations with gnome-terminal, you'll probably need to change it's 
  default options.

%p
  Multi-User RVM creates a script in /etc/profile.d, which is being sourced on startup. Also, most people put 
  the RVM sourcing line required to load RVM in their ~/.bash_profile for Single-User installs. By default, 
  gnome-terminal runs Bash as usual, as a non-login shell, therefore skipping /etc/profile* and executing only 
  the user's ~/.bashrc. This means that RVM doesn't load and you get the infamous 'RVM is not a function' 
  message.

%p 
  For RVM to work properly, you have to set the 'Run command as login shell' checkbox on the Title and Command 
  tab inside of gnome-terminal's Settings page. Like this:

  especially if you are in doubt, or advised by other sites to not use it.
