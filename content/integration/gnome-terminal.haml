%h1 Integrating rvm with gnome-terminal

%p
  If you are going to use multi-user rvm installation with gnome-terminal, you'll probably need to change it's default options.

%p
  Multi-user rvm creates a script in /etc/profile.d, which is being sourced on startup. By default, gnome-terminal runs bash as usual, non-login shell, therefore skipping /etc/profile* and executing only ~/.bashrc

%p 
  For rvm to work properly, you have to choose between two options:

  %ol
    %li
      Set 'Run command as login shell' checkbox on Title and Command tab inside of gnome-terminal settings.
    %li
      Add the following line to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file:
      %pre.code
        source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh
